# Overview

In this guide you will learn:

* How to automatically provision [the datalake you manually provisioned here](../1-manual-emr-deployment/README.md) using CloudFormation and/or Ansible.


**We assume you know the Ansible basics ([playbooks](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html), [roles](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html), and [inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html) concepts) and are able to quickly pick up on the [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudformation/) principles.**

# First steps with Ansible and CloudFormation
